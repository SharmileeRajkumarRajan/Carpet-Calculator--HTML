<h1>Machu Picchu </h1>
<br>
<p>
Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca site located 2,430 metres (7,970 ft) above sea level.
 It is located in the Cusco Region, Urubamba Province, Machupicchu District in Peru.

It is situated on a mountain ridge above the Sacred Valley which is 80 kilometres (50 mi) northwest of Cuzco and 
through which the Urubamba River flows. Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was built as an estate for 
the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438â€“1472). Often mistakenly referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas"
 (a title more accurately applied to Vilcabamba), it is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization.

The Incas built the estate around 1450, but abandoned it a century later at the time of the Spanish Conquest.
 Although known locally, it was not known to the Spanish during the colonial period and remained unknown to the 
 outside world before being brought to international attention in 1911 by the American historian Hiram Bingham. 
 Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of what the structures 
 originally looked like. By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, restoration continues today.

Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historical Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.
In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide Internet poll.
