<h1>The Colosseum </h1>
<br>
<p>The Colosseum or Coliseum (/kɒləˈsiːəm/ kol-ə-see-əm), also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre 
 or Colosseo , is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy. Built of concrete and sand,
 it is the largest amphitheatre ever built and is considered one of the greatest works of architecture 
 and engineering ever.

The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in 72 AD,
 and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir Titus. Further modifications were made during the reign 
 of Domitian (81–96). These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in 
 Latin for its association with their family name (Flavius).

The Colosseum could hold, it is estimated, between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators,
 having an average audience of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles
 such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical 
 mythology. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such
 purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.

Although partially ruined because of damage caused by earthquakes and stone-robbers, the Colosseum 
is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome. It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions and 
has also links to the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit "Way of the Cross"
 procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum
