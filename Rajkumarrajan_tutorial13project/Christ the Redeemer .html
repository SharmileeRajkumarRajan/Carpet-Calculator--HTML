Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: 
[ˈkɾistu ʁedẽˈtoʁ], local dialect: [ˈkɾiʃtu ɦedẽˈtoɦ]) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ 
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French sculptor Paul Landowski and built by the Brazilian 
engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with the French engineer Albert Caquot. The face 
was created by the Romanian artist Gheorghe Leonida. The statue is 30 metres (98 ft) tall, not including
 its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal, and its arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.

The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is located at the
 peak of the 700-metre (2,300 ft) Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca Forest National Park 
 overlooking the city of Rio. A symbol of Christianity across the world, the statue has also 
 become a cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil, and is listed as one of the New Seven
 Wonders of the World.It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone, and was constructed between 
 1922 and 1931
