<h1>Petra </h1>
<br>
<p>
Petra  is a historical and archaeological city in the southern Jordanian governorate of Ma'an that is
 famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system. Another name for Petra is the Rose City due 
 to the color of the stone out of which it is carved.

Established possibly as early as 312 BC as the capital city of the Arab Nabataeans,
 it is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction.
 It lies on the slope of Jebel al-Madhbah (identified by some as the biblical Mount Hor) 

in a basin among the mountains which form the eastern flank of Arabah (Wadi Araba),
 the large valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. Petra has been a UNESCO World 
 Heritage Site since 1985.

The site remained unknown to the Western world until 1812, when it was introduced by Swiss explorer Johann 
Ludwig Burckhardt. It was described as "a rose-red city half as old as time" in a Newdigate Prize-winning poem 
by John William Burgon. UNESCO has described it as "one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural 
heritage"
